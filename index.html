  About Me
</h4>

  <!-- adding body paragraphs -->
  <p>I have been an AZ Driver for a bit under a year now. Even though my job pays the bills, I do prefer having a career that provides more safety and a better work and home life balance.</p> 

  <p>
    I originally wanted to pursue a career in software but due to personal reasons I had to discontinue my education. However, now I am at the right place in my life to put in the time and effort to transition towards software which I am more passionate about.</p>
  

 <p> 
    So far at Thinkful, I have had a lot to learn.  From Javascript basics to HTML and CSS, I have learned a lot and thoroughly enjoyed it as well. If you are looking for a software developer who enjoys his work and loves working both alone and in a team, please contact me!
